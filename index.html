                <h1>A young programmer and a creative designer.</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Zarina, and I am 15 years old. I have been attending an IT preparatory course for a year.
                    I
                    am mostly interested in design — making websites look beautiful — and I really enjoy it. My goal is
                    to
                    become a famous programmer in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm very interested in learning new things and always strive to improve myself.
                    Art and technology inspire me — they help me express my ideas.
                    I love combining beauty and functionality through design.
                    For me, creativity is a process of play and discovery that brings me joy.
                    Every project is a new experience and an opportunity to grow.

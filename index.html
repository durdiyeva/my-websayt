                        My name is <span>Zarina</span>, and I am 15 years old. I have been attending an IT
                        preparatorycourse for a
                        year.
                        I
                        am mostly interested in design making websites look beautiful and I really enjoy it. My goal is
                        to
                        become a famous programmer in the future.

                        I'm very interested in learning new things and always strive to improve myself.
                        Art and technology inspire me â€” they help me express my ideas.
                        I love combining beauty and functionality through design.
                        For me, creativity is a process of play and discovery that brings me joy.
                        Every project is a new experience and an opportunity to grow.
